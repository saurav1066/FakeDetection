fakes detection

Improvements with more time
•	Implement more comprehensive data validation steps post-cleanup to automatically verify that no essential data has been mistakenly removed and that the dataset conforms to expected formats and value ranges.
•	Incorporate a system to dynamically handle data types based on the content of each column.
•	Evaluating whether the chosen model and features adequately address the problem and  consider experimenting with different models like Support Vector Machine or Logistic Regression or feature sets if performance is suboptimal.
